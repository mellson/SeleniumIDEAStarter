# SeleniumIDEAStarter
Starter project for doing Java Selenium testing with IntelliJ.

## Getting started
Open this project with IntelliJ, which should be pre-configured to work with Java.
This should trigger a download of the dependencies you need.

Run the pre-configured test in `WebTests` to trigger the download of the web-driver for your platform.

Now you are all setup to create your own tests.
