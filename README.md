# SeleniumIDEAStarter
Starter project for doing Java Selenium testing with IntelliJ.

## Getting started
Open this project with IntelliJ, which should be preconfigured to work with Java.
This should trigger a download of the dependencies you need.

Run the preconfigured test in `WebTests` to trigger the download of the webdriver for your platform.

Now you are all setup to create your own tests.
